# Introduction

## Purpose

Create an editor in order to facilitate the creation of 
the Konig programming language.

## Intended Audience

The readers of this document are those who are expected to have already read
at least the 1.0 spec for Konig. They are either expected to review the plan or are
the person(s) who will be creating the editor.

## Intended Use

The users of the editor are expected to be (generally) new programmers.
They are expected to have no to a basic understanding of the language, thus the editor should also
facilitate the learning of the language.

# Overall Description

## User Needs

The user should be provided an editor that abstracts the file structure onto
a canvas on which blocks and wires can be placed. The editor should be capable of dynamically
placing blocks and wires on the canvas and then saving to the underlying konig file format.

## Assumptions and Dependencies

For the preliminary version of the editor, the editor is expected to be implemented on top of
the JsMacros screen library in minecraft. in the future this may be done other ways, perhaps in a
standalone program.
